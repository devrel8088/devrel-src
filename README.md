# Advocate Site Builder

This repository holds HUGO configuration for a statically driven
website site to showcase Developer Advocates team memebers.

## Static Site Build

Build the site by pointing to an output directory:

    hugo -D -d output_directory

Currently built real site is served via Pages on [Make Jar Not War dot com](http://www.makejarnotwar.com)

## Customize your page

If you wish. there are a few things to know:

* Check `content/posts` for your cooresponding bio page. Page Variables may be changed to desired values.

* Images go into `static/images`.

* Front-page thumbnails should fit 64x64 or some sane thumbnail size.

## Design

Currently using the hugo theme 'github-style'.

Plan to re-use any available VMWare stylings. If SASS plugins are available, I would like to adapt that as well.

## Wheres my PUSH ??
